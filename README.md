Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

STOCK is a meticulously crafted recipe website designed to offer users an intuitive and engaging culinary experience. With a focus on simplicity and functionality, STOCK strikes the perfect balance between ease of use and depth of content.

The website is divided into two main sections: the daily featured recipe and the recipe gallery. Each day, a new and carefully selected recipe takes center stage, providing users with a tantalizing culinary inspiration. From savory mains to indulgent desserts, every dish is chosen to showcase a diverse range of flavors and cuisines.

But STOCK goes beyond just presenting recipes; it's a platform dedicated to celebrating the art of cooking. Alongside each dish, users can explore detailed information about the ingredients used, gaining insights into the flavors and techniques that make each recipe unique.

For those looking to explore further, STOCK offers an extensive gallery of previous recipes. Whether you're planning a special occasion or simply looking for weeknight dinner ideas, the recipe gallery provides a wealth of culinary inspiration. Clear and high-quality imagery accompanies each recipe, allowing users to visualize the final dish and make informed choices about what to cook.

Behind the scenes, STOCK leverages advanced technology to enhance the user experience. The integration of the Edamam API provides access to a vast database of over 2.3 million recipes, ensuring a wide variety of options for users to explore. Additionally, the use of React Spring, React Router, and Styled Components ensures a smooth and seamless browsing experience.

In summary, STOCK is more than just a recipe website; it's a comprehensive resource for anyone passionate about cooking. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a novice cook, STOCK is here to inspire and empower you on your culinary journey.
