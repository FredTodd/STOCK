STOCK is a meticulously crafted recipe website designed to offer users an intuitive and engaging culinary experience. With a focus on simplicity and functionality, STOCK strikes the perfect balance between ease of use and depth of content.

The website is divided into two main sections: the daily featured recipe and the recipe gallery. Each day, a new and carefully selected recipe takes center stage, providing users with a tantalizing culinary inspiration. From savory mains to indulgent desserts, every dish is chosen to showcase a diverse range of flavors and cuisines.

But STOCK goes beyond just presenting recipes; it's a platform dedicated to celebrating the art of cooking. Alongside each dish, users can explore detailed information about the ingredients used, gaining insights into the flavors and techniques that make each recipe unique.

For those looking to explore further, STOCK offers an extensive gallery of previous recipes. Whether you're planning a special occasion or simply looking for weeknight dinner ideas, the recipe gallery provides a wealth of culinary inspiration. Clear and high-quality imagery accompanies each recipe, allowing users to visualize the final dish and make informed choices about what to cook.

Behind the scenes, STOCK leverages advanced technology to enhance the user experience. The integration of the Edamam API provides access to a vast database of over 2.3 million recipes, ensuring a wide variety of options for users to explore. Additionally, the use of React Spring, React Router, and Styled Components ensures a smooth and seamless browsing experience.

In summary, STOCK is more than just a recipe website; it's a comprehensive resource for anyone passionate about cooking. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a novice cook, STOCK is here to inspire and empower you on your culinary journey.
